## Instructions
In this Exercise, we will learn how to open files from a web server. we will also learn how to retrieve dynamic data from the server to update the client application. We will make use of AJAX to accomplish this.
   
1.	Remember to make a `git commit` after completing a step. Title each commit with "Step _ complete" then write a short sentence of **what** was changed and **why**.

2.	Open solar.html. 
    Fill in the appropriate "documentation" (code comments) in the top comments. Scroll through the document to get familiarized with the content. Notice that the file contains a mostly empty `<table>` structure. We will use JavaScript, in combination with AJAX, to write in most of the content dynamically.

3.	Open the JavaScript document named `script.js`. 
    Add all of the appropriate documentation to the top of the file, with your name and the date. The beginnings of the script have been set up.
    
    A.	There are a couple of **global variables**, a function named `getWeather()`, and the script creates some `event listeners`.
    
    B.	The event listeners are set up to call `getWeather()` on the page load event and on some click events.
    
    C.	We will employ AJAX to retrieve current data from the server so that we can use it to populate the web page.

# Get Docker-Compose is running

1.	Getting up and running with LAMP via DOCKER.
    - Once upon a time we used to need install and run a bunch of stuff and things to get this running like WAMP and XAMPP, etc. But we got **docker** now ! So lets go into the exercise folder and get started.
    - You wont need to worry about the following folders: config, data, or ssl. You may occationally need to check out logs however.
    - CD into the correct directory `cd Exercise-LAMP/`
    - Make sure docker is running.
    - Inside  `01-AJAX/Exercise-LAMP/` run `docker-compose up` this should install everything you need and start up our server on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
    - Bookmark the [docker guide](https://gist.github.com/WestMec200/bf0978a4ce1754748f5cf79849196def).
  
1. Find exercise files inside `01-AJAX/Exercise-LAMP/www/` you should see a bunch of stuff like `index.php`, `solar.html`, etc.

2.  Open [solar.html](http://localhost:8000/solar.html)

 
# Chrome Network Tools

1. Open the **Developer Tools** and go to the [Network tab](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/). This tab shows details about each HTTP request and response related to the current page. Refresh the page if necessary, the request only registers when the tools are open, so it might start off empty. In Chrome, hit **F5** for a list of the messages.
2. Find the **solar.html** message and click it. the summary of the messages is replaced with the detail of the clicked message.
3.	Examine the detail of the message. You can see **General** details of the message. This is followed by both **Response** and **Request Headers**. Examine the Request Headers information in detail.

 
# Examining PHP Proxy and Getting API Key
   
1.	We are going to use a server based PHP file as a proxy for our AJAX response. On the client side, open `solar.php` in your IDE. Let’s examine the contents.

    a.	First notice the opening and closing PHP tags: `<?php and ?>`. The indicate that what is enclosed is a PHP script. PHP scripts are often embedded in HTML files with .php extensions.
    
    b.	Line 2 creates a PHP variable `$WeatherSource`. PHP variables begin with the `$` sign.

    c.	The variable is a string variable, the PHP **concatenation** operator is the period `(.)` .

    d.	The first part of the string is a **URL** to access a **web service** that we will use for the weather forecast. Notice the `/apikey/` 
    part. We will substitute a key in there that will allow access to the service.

    e.	`$_GET` is a global PHP variable. It holds the contents of whatever data was sent by the browser **HTTP GET request** for this resource. The data is sent in **name/value pairs**, so the `$_GET` parameter holds the name of the pair that is of interest.

    f.	Next are two PHP `header()` functions, here being used to set two response header pairs.

    g.	The PHP `readfile()` function is being used to return the forecast data as the body of the HTTP response. Let’s go to the forecast site at developer.forecast.io. 

2.	Now we have to obtain a value for the **API key** to get access to the web service. We will all have our own. Click the **Sign Up** button, enter an email address and password, and get an account. Make sure that you remember this sign in. when you are done, you will receive your personal key.

3.	Make a copy of the key and go back to `solar.php` . Paste the key over the text apikey in the URL string. Save the file and move a copy over to your web domain.
 
#  Step 1 - Instantiating an XMLHttpRequest Object
   

1.	Open the script.js file in the IDE. We will first add a httpRequest variable to the global variables. It will be used to track whether or not we have an existing request open. This will facilitate reusing the XHR object to optimize page loading:
    ```js
      var httpRequest = false;
    ```
2.	Below the globals, let’s create a function that will handle XHR instantiation. Include an alert() for testing:

    ```js
    function getRequestObject() {
       alert("getRequestObject()"); 
    }
    ```

3.	Let’s give it a test by calling the new function from the `getWeather()` function. Just before the closing, add the following code:
    ```js
    if (!httpRequest) {
        httpRequest = getRequestObject();
    }
    ```
Let’s move that code to the server and give it a browser test. We should get an alert indicating our function is being called.

4.	Now let’s build this into a try / catch structure to give us some protection:
    ```js
    try {
       httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
    }
    catch (requestError) {
        document.querySelector("p.error").innerHTML = "Forecast not 
            supported by your browser.";
        document.querySelector("p.error").style.display = "block";
        return false;
    }
    return httpRequest;
    ```
Let’s give this a browser test for both syntax and to see if any errors are thrown.
 
# Step 2 - Opening and Sending a Request

1.	
    Open the **script.js** file in the IDE. We now need to target the server resource and send a request. We will add this code to the bottom of the `getWeather()` function. We will first `abort()` any outstanding requests, we will then construct our URL string in the `open()` method, and we will finally `send()` our request with no body: 
    ```js
    httpRequest.abort();
    httpRequest.open("get", "solar.php?" + "lat=" + latitude + 
        "&lng=" + longitude, true );
    httpRequest.send(null);
    ```
    Save and copy the modified file to your server domain.
 
2.	
    In the browser, turn on the Developer Tools and go to the Network tab. **Load or refresh solar.html.** One of the messages should be marked solar.php?... Look at the Headers tab and under General there should be a well-formed URL with the correct name-value pairs. Look at the Response Headers and you should see the proper Cache-Control and Connection pairs that were set in the solar.php file.

3.	
    Switch to the Console tab. Type in httpRequest.responseText and press Enter. Chrome has good auto-complete for this. You should see a long string of data. This is your response from the web service. We will have to learn how to process that next.

# Step 3 - Processing Response Data
   
1.	Open the script.js file in the IDE. We now need to Process the response data. To do this we will build a new function directly below the `getWeather()` function: 

    ```js
      function fillWeather() {
       
      }
    ```

2.	Now let’s build out the function, looking for a **readyState of 4** indicating data is loaded and a **status of 200**, indicating request was successful. **Both must be true to process the data**. We will then convert the JSON data to a JavaScript object:

    ```js
       if (httpRequest.readyState === 4 && httpRequest.status === 200) {
           weatherReport = JSON.parse(httpRequest.responseText);
       }
       
    ```
 
3.	Next we have to set up the XMLHttpRequest event property to use the new function as its event handler. We will do this as the last command in the `getWeather` function:
    
   ```js
    httpRequest.onreadystatechange = fillWeather;
   ```

Let’s move this over to the web server domain.

4. 
   In the browser, turn on the Developer Tools and go to the Console tab. 
   Load or refresh solar.html. Type in weatherReport and press Enter. The object sitting in that variable is displayed. Expand the triangle next to it. This will display the contents of the object, name-value pairs. Expand each of the properties and you can clearly see the weather data.

# Step 4 - Adding Response Data to the Page
   
1.	
    Open the script.js file in the IDE. We now need to get the processed data onto the page. To do this we will build out some code that uses DOM access to fill in the data to the HTML elements. In the **fillWeather()** function, at the bottom of the if statement, let’s first build some variables to support this task: 

   ```js
      if (httpRequest.readyState === 4 && httpRequest.status === 200) {
        weatherReport = JSON.parse(httpRequest.responseText);
        var days = ["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"];
        var dateValue = new Date(weatherReport.daily.data[0].time);
        var dayOfWeek = dateValue.getDay();
        var rows = document.querySelectorAll("section.week table tbody tr");
        document.querySelector("section.week table caption").
            innerHTML = selectedCity;
      }
   ```

   Move this over to the domain, run solar.html, and check the Console for syntax or other errors.
 
1. Ok now for some pretty detailed code to populate that document. Let’s take it in small enough bites so that we do not get into trouble. First, let’s see if we can get the table to display by adding the following code inside `if (httpRequest.readyState === 4 && httpRequest.status === 200) {...}` and test our above code:
   ```js
        document.querySelector("section.week table caption").style.display = "block";
        document.querySelector("section.week table").style.display = "inline-block";
   ```
    <img width="1101" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 9 36 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52793815/65011933-eb29ea00-d904-11e9-9c3e-8a385c561e86.png">

    Let’s test that on the server. We should get our selected city showing and 7 days of sun symbols that come from our HTML file.

3.	
    Now we can build ourselves a for loop to continue populating those `<table>` rows. We will place that directly above the two previous statements:

   ```js
        for (var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++) {
            var firstCell = 
                rows[i].getElementsByTagName("td")[0];
            var secondCell = 
                rows[i].getElementsByTagName("td")[1];
            var thirdCell = 
                rows[i].getElementsByTagName("td")[2];
            firstCell.innerHTML = days[dayOfWeek];
        }    
    ```

    A server test of this code should give us at least one of the days of the week displayed on each row. We will fix that next.

4.	
    Let’s fix up the day for the rows by calculating on each iteration directly below the previous code in the for loop:

    ```js
            if (dayOfWeek + 1 === 7) {
                dayOfWeek = 0;
            }
            else {
                dayOfWeek++;
            }
    ```

    A server test of this should give us the proper display of a week.
 
5.	
    Now let’s complete our `<table>` cells for each row
    
    ```js
            var sun = Math.round((1 - 
                weatherReport.daily.data[i].cloudCover) *100, 0)
            
            if (sun > 90) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,171,0)";
            }
            else if (sun > 80 && sun <= 90) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,179,25)";
            }
            else if (sun > 70 && sun <= 80) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,188,51)";
            }
            else if (sun > 60 && sun <= 70) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,196,77)";
            }
            else if (sun > 50 && sun <= 60) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,205,102)";
            }
            else if (sun > 40 && sun <= 50) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,213,128)";
            }
            else if (sun > 30 && sun <= 40) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,221,153)";
            }
            else if (sun > 20 && sun <= 30) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,230,179)";
            }
            else if (sun > 10 && sun <= 20) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,238,204)";
            }
            else if (sun <= 10) {
                secondCell.style.color = "rgb(255,247,230)";
            }
            secondCell.style.fontSize = "2.5em";
            thirdCell.innerHTML = sun + "%";
    ```

    A server test of this should give us the sun percentage for each day.
 
6.	
    In your browser, open developer.forecast.io. Go to the bottom and click the Terms of Service link. Under Attribution, you will see that there are some things that you must do to legally display data gotten from this service. This is an **Intellectual Property prerogative**. You must display a message and open a link to the site from your app. Let’s open **solar.html** and prep it for this task. After the closing `</table>` tag, enter the following code:

    ```html
        <p class="credit">Powered by <a href="http://forecast.io">forecast</a></p>
    ```
    Save that and copy it to your web domain.

7.	
    Return to script.js and let’s enter the following code to finish this off. Make this the last line in fillWeather():

    ```js
        document.querySelector("section.week p.credit").style.display = "block";
    ```

Give this a server test and try out the link.
